# First Game on LUA
My first project in LUA. Never knew any LUA before this so it's still a work in progress haha.

A 2D game with animated sprites, follow-around camera, and in-game physics.
Now implemented modular game loading to allow users to load different games from menu.

Game1 has a simpler map, while Game2 has a larger and slightly more complex map.

Built with LUA and LÖVE 2D.
